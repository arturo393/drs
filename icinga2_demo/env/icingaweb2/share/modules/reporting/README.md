# Icinga Reporting

Icinga Reporting is the central component for reporting related functionality in the monitoring web frontend and
framework Icinga Web 2. The engine allows you to create reports over a specified time period for ad-hoc and scheduled
generation of reports. Other modules use the provided functionality in order to provide concrete reports.

If you are looking for SLA reports for your hosts and services, please also install the
[idoreports](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-idoreports) module.

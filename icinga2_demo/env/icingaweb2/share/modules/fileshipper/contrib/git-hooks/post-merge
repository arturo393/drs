# Trigger Director config rendering when something changed

# This is a git hook that will run after `git pull`. In case any file was
# changed it will instruct Director to re-render the current configuration.
#
# Add this file to your git working directory as `.git/hooks/post-merge`. It
# has to executable (`chmod +x`), otherwise it wouldn't run. The `icingacli`
# has to be on your `PATH` when running `git pull`.
#
# TODO: verify whether HEAD@{1} instead of ORIG_HEAD should be preferred
